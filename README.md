Question: The script is supposed to output the cosine of angle 1 radian, but instead it is throwing an error. Please fix the code so that it prints out the expected output.

import math
print(math.cosine(1))
Expected output:

0.5403023058681397

Hint: You could get a list of all available methods of the math module with dir(math) and see whether cosine is there or not.
